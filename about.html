            I am a spunky Account/Operations Manager with a growth mindset. What sets me apart as an account manager is my “prior-life” work experience on the patent prosecution and litigation side of the IP world. Before becoming an account manager, I spent a decade filing US and PCT patent applications. <!-- This IP legal background enables me to bridge the legal and tech needs of our customers from a pragmatic, real-world IP space perspective. I am fascinated by the intersection of AI SaaS/SEM, category/computational design and patent search analytics powered by machine learning. My passion is to shape IP workflow management, analytics, & transactions in a much more dynamic, intuitive and easier way than ever before. --></p>
